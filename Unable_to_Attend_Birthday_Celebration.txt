Subject: Unable to Attend Tomorrow's Celebration

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to attend Bob's birthday party tomorrow at 6 PM due to prior commitments.

Please extend my best wishes to Bob, and I hope you all have a wonderful time celebrating together!

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Pepillo
